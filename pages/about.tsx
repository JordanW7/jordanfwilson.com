        <SectionTitle>Why I build</SectionTitle>
        <ContentHeader>#Technology</ContentHeader>
        <p>
          The improvements in technology over the last short 15 years have been
          huge. We interact with technology on a daily basis and the tech
          industry now has one of the most significant impacts on the world. The
          industry is constantly changing and I believe that change is good, and
          that learning should never stop. I love learning new things on a daily
          basis as a developer and being at the forefront of this phenomenal
          industry. Over the last several years things have begun moving
          incredibly fast and web development is becoming even more important as
          Web Apps replace traditional software.
        </p>
        <ContentHeader>#ThinkDifferent</ContentHeader>
        <p>
          I completed a Bachelor of Music with Honours (1st) in Music
          Composition after leaving High School, which gives me a unique
          background and skillset. Thinking creatively, problem solving, being
          responsible and dependable, being able to work well with others and
          communicate effectively, critical reflection, performing under
          pressure, adaptability, analytical skills, attention to detail,
          self-management, planning and time management skills are all second
          nature to music graduates. For this reason, musicians make excellent
          developers.
        </p>
        <ContentHeader>#UserFocused</ContentHeader>
        <p>
          I understand the importance of user centered development. I am
          obsessed with details (in a good way), clean beautiful UIs and
          easy-to-use functionality. Putting myself in the user’s shoes during
          development, then fine-tuning the product with user feedback is
          something I spend extra time on. I know that often, little things make
          all the difference.
