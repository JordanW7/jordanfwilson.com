        <p><span className="about-contents-header">#Technology</span><br />The improvements in technology over the last short 15 years have been huge. We interact with technology on a daily basis and the tech industry now has one of the most significant impacts on the world. The industry is constantly changing and <span className="highlight">I believe that change is good, and that learning should never stop.</span> I love learning new things on a daily basis as a Developer and being at the forefront of this phenomenal industry. Over the last several years things have begun moving incredibly fast and web development is becoming even more important as Web Apps replace traditional software.</p>
        
        <p><span className="about-contents-header">#ThinkDifferent</span><br />I completed a <span className="highlight">Bachelor of Music with Honours (1st) in Music Composition</span> after leaving High School, which gives me a unique background and skillset.  Thinking creatively, problem solving, being responsible and dependable, being able to work well with others and communicate effectively, critical reflection, performing under pressure, adaptability, analytical skills, attention to detail, self-management, planning and time management skills are all second nature to music graduates. <span className="highlight">Musicians are becoming increasingly well known for being excellent developers.</span> "The greatest scientists are artists as well." - Albert Einstein.</p>
        <p>I love a good challenge and trying new things to solve them. I really enjoy the creative process of envisioning solutions to problems and developing products. I now develop technology that <span className="highlight">improves the way we learn, complete everyday tasks and the way we do our work.</span></p>

        <p><span className="about-contents-header">#UserFocused</span><br />I have significant end-user experience and know the <span className="highlight">importance of user centered development.</span> I am obsessed with details (in a good way), clean beautiful UIs and easy-to-use functionality. Putting myself in the userâ€™s shoes during development, then fine-tuning the product with user feedback is something I spend extra time on. I know that often, <span className="highlight">little things make all the difference.</span></p>
        <p>I gained invaluable experience from previous jobs where I taught people how to use technology to improve their lives or workflow, and from my own experiences as a user using a large multitude of different technologies.</p>
        
        <p><span className="about-contents-header">#GlobalAwareness</span><br />Having travelled extensively through 18 countries, spending the most of my life in New Zealand and now living in London, I also have a <span className="highlight">global awareness and understanding of other cultures.</span> Countries I've been to include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Cambodia, China, Czech Republic, England, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Scotland, South Korea, Thailand, U.A.E, Vietnam and Wales.</p>
